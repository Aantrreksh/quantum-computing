# View the cost
{: #view-cost}

At any time, you can see how much cost has been incurred by jobs associated with an instance.
{: shortdesc}



## View instance cost
{: #view-instance-cost}

To determine how much has been billed to an instance during the current billing cycle, from the [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances){: external}, click the instance to open its details page.

These are the fields relevant to cost:

* **Billing cycle QR usage**: The amount of quantum runtime used by this instance during the current billing cycle
* **Billing cycle cost**: The total cost of running jobs during the current billing cycle

You can view your billing cycle on the [Billing and usage page](https://cloud.ibm.com/billing){: external}.

## View job cost
{: #view-job-cost}

To determine how much has been billed to each job associated with an instance, from the [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances){: external}, click the instance to open its details page. Next, on the left side, click Jobs.

These are the columns relevant to cost:

* **QR usage**: The amount of quantum runtime used by this job
* **Cost**: The total cost of running this job
