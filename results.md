# View final job results

{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="10m"}

This tutorial describes how to review final results after running a job. For an example of running a job, see [Get started with the Estimator primitive](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-example-estimator) or [Get started with the Sampler primitive](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-example-sampler).
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-results}

Run your job and note the job ID.

## Check the status
{: #check-job-status-before-results}

After the job completes, you can view the results.

Immediately after running the job, follow up the Qiskit Runtime IBMRuntimeService.run() method by running `job.status()`.

If you ran other jobs since running the job you want to investigate, run `job = service.job(job_id)` then run `job.status()`.

You can optionally run the [List job details API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-job-details-jid){: external}, manually or by using [Swagger](https://us-east.quantum-computing.test.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_job_details_jid){: external} to check the job's status.


## View the results
{: #view-results}


Follow up the Qiskit Runtime IBMRuntimeService.run() method by running `job.result()`.

Alternatively, run the [list job results API](/apidocs/quantum-computing#get-job-results-jid){: external} ([Swagger link](https://us-east.quantum-computing.cloud.ibm.com/openapi/#/Jobs/get_job_results_jid){: external}).
