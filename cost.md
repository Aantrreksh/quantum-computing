# Qiskit Runtime Standard plan
{: #cost}

Learn how to determine cost when using the Standard plan.
{: shortdesc}

## Pricing plan overview
{: #pricing-overview}

The Standard plan charges you per _runtime second_. The following diagram illustrates how job cost is calculated. 

![This diagram shows that everything before the program starts (such as queuing) is free.  The Once the job starts, it costs $1.60 per second.](images/Runtime_Accounting_Diagram.png "Runtime second accounting"){: caption="Figure 1. Runtime second accounting" caption-side="bottom"}

- Use the [Getting started guide](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-quickstart) to create an instance and run your first job.
- Review [Get started with the Sampler primitive](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-example-sampler) for a step-by-step example of using this primitive.
- Use Qiskit [tutorials](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials.html){: external} to learn how to create circuits with Qiskit.
