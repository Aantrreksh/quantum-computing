# Getting started
{: #quickstart}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-completion-time="25m"}

This tutorial walks you through the steps to set up a {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} service instance, log into your service instance, and run your first job on a quantum computer.
{: shortdesc}


## Create a service instance
{: #create-configure}
{: step}

If you already created your {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} service instance, skip to the next step.

1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} Provisioning page](/catalog/services/quantum-computing){: external}, select the Create tab, then choose the appropriate service plan, depending on what you need access to:
      - **Lite**: Free simulators-only plan to help you get started with {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}}. Learn to use {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} using our examples and tutorials for one of the pre-built programs available for executing circuits efficiently.
      - **Standard**: A pay-as-you-go model for accessing IBM quantum systems. Build your own programs and leverage all the benefits of {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} by running on real quantum hardware.
2. After completing the required information, click **Create**.

## Install Qiskit packages
{: #install-packages}
{: step}

Install these packages.  They let you create circuits and work with primitive programs via {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}}. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Qiskit textbook.](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-appendix/qiskit.html){: external}. You need to keep these packages updated:

```Python
pip install qiskit
```
{: codeblock}

```Python
pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
```
{: codeblock}

## Find your access credentials
{: #find-credentials}
{: step}

Next, you will find your account credentials and authenticate with the service.

1. Find and copy your API key. From the [API keys page](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys){: external}, view or create your API key.
2. Find your service instance name or Cloud Resource Name (CRN).
   - To find your service instance name, open the [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances){: external} and find your instance.  The service instance name is in the **Name** column.
   - To find your CRN, open the [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances){: external} and click your instance. In the page that opens, click the icon to copy your CRN.

## Authenticate to the service
{: #authentication}
{: step}

To authenticate to the service, call  `IBMRuntimeService` with your IBM Cloud API key and the CRN or Service name:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService

IBMRuntimeService(auth="cloud", token="<IBM Cloud API key>", instance="<IBM Cloud CRN or Service instance name>")

```
{: codeblock}


Instead, you can optionally save your credentials to disk (in the $HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json file).  If you don't save your credentials to disk, you have to run the previous command every time you start a new session.

If you save your credentials to disk, you only need to use `IBMRuntimeService()` in the future to initialize your account.
{: note}

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService

# Save account to disk.
IBMRuntimeService.save_account(auth="cloud", token="<IBM Cloud API key>", instance="<IBM Cloud CRN or Service instance name>")

service = IBMRuntimeService()
```
{: codeblock}

If you need to update your saved credentials, run `save_account` again, passing in `overwrite=True`  and the updated credentials.  For more information about managing your account see the [account management tutorial](https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/tutorials/04_account_management.html){: external}.

For instructions to use the cloud Quantum Qiskit API, see the [authentication](/apidocs/quantum-computing#authentication){: external} section in the API documentation.

## Test your setup
{: #test-setup}
{: step}

Run the Hello World program to ensure that your environment is set up properly.

If you did not save your credentials to disk, specify `IBMRuntimeService.save_account(auth="cloud", token=<IBM Cloud API key>, instance=<IBM Cloud CRN or Service instance name>)
` instead of `IBMRuntimeService()` in the following code.

```Python
from qiskit.test.reference_circuits import ReferenceCircuits
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import IBMRuntimeService

service = IBMRuntimeService()
program_inputs = {'iterations': 1}
options = {"backend_name": "ibmq_qasm_simulator"}
job = service.run(program_id="hello-world",
                  options=options,
                  inputs=program_inputs
                 )
print(f"job id: {job.job_id}")
result = job.result()
print(result)
```
{: codeblock}

Result:

```text
All done!
```

## Choose a program to run
{: #choose-program}
{: step}

Qiskit Runtime uses [primitive programs](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-overview) to interface with quantum computers. The following programs are publicly available. Choose the appropriate link to continue learning how to run a program.

- **[Sampler](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-example-sampler)**:  
       Allows users to more accurately contextualize counts. It takes a user circuit as an input and allows them to generate an error mitigated readout of quasiprobabilities. This enables users to more efficiently evaluate the possibility of multiple relevant data points in the context of destructive interference.
- **[Estimator](/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-example-estimator)**:  
       Allows users to efficiently calculate and interpret expectation values of quantum operators required for many algorithms. It allows users to specify a list of circuits and observables and provides the capability to selectively group between the lists to efficiently evaluate expectation values and variances for a given parameter input.Â
