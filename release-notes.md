{: release-note}

You can run jobs on both physical quantum devices, as well as quantum device simulators.
New API endpoints have been added to allow you to view device information.
There is a free plan as well as a lite plan, to allow access to simulators or physical quantum devices.
If you do not specify a device for your job to run on, the job will be sent to the least busy system or simulator that you have access to.

Introducing {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} (internal-only). Get a glimpse of the quantum computing future with our world-leading Qiskit Runtime, a new architecture that delivers significant performance enhancements to program execution. Our physical systems and simulators (cloud-based classical emulators of quantum systems) now enable you to experience frictionless quantum computing; that is, the ability to execute quantum programs in an environment where the classical computer is physically closer to the quantum computer. Test programs and algorithms, and develop new models with our cloud-based quantum runtime for drastically improved capacity and higher performance today.
