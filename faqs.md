FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} might include questions about xxx or xxx. To find all FAQs for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, see our [FAQ library](/docs/faqs).
{: shortdesc}



## What are {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} Services?
{: #what-are-runtimes}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} Services are a runtime environment through the IBM Cloud providing access to IBM Quantum’s quantum processors and quantum simulators. They allow users to run quantum programs, which require specialized quantum hardware coupled closely with standard, “classical”, computer hardware.

## Why is IBM launching {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} Services?
{: #faq-why-runtime}
{: faq}

IBM has made quantum computers available through the Cloud since 2016. Starting in 2022, IBM is integrating with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} to offer {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} API access, allowing for smoother customer experience.

## What can {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} Services *not* do?
{: #faq-runtime-not}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} Services provides runtime access to IBM quantum computers. Today, these computers are small and noisy research tools. These devices can be used to solve small problems and to explore this new and exciting field. Quantum computers today cannot outperform other existing computational tools.

## What skills are required to use {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} Services?
{: #faq-skills}
{: faq}

{{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} Services are meant to be accessible to anyone comfortable with Python. Pre-defined Qiskit runtime programs can be called and executed seamlessly. To create novel programs, familiarity with quantum computing is required. To create new algorithms to embed in programs, quantum computing expertise is essential.

## Can I use {{site.data.keyword.qiskit_runtime_notm}} Services with my IBM Cloud lite account?
{: #faq-lite}
{: faq}

Yes, but the Lite plan only provides you access to IBM quantum simulators. To use IBM Quantum systems, you need to upgrade to an IBM pay-as-you-go cloud account.
